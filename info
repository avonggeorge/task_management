given that:

Here's a breakdown of these components:

id: This defines a column named id.

db.Column: This is a class that defines a column in a database table.
db.Integer: This specifies the type of the column. Here, id is an integer.
primary_key=True: This designates this column as the primary key, which uniquely identifies each record in the table.
title: Another column in the table.

db.String(80): This defines a column that stores strings with a maximum length of 80 characters.
nullable=False: This means that this column cannot be null; it must contain a value when a Notes record is created.
content: A column for holding the note's content.

db.Text: This specifies that the column can contain a large amount of text.
nullable=True: This allows the column to be null, meaning a note can exist without any content.
created_at: A column for tracking when the note was created.

db.DateTime: This indicates that the column will store date and time values.
default=db.func.current_timestamp(): This sets the default value for this column to the current timestamp when a record is created.
